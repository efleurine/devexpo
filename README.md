# DevExpo

## About DevExpo

DevExpo is the flagship event of Facebook Developer Circle Port-au-Prince where we give the spotlight to
locally developed applications and services.

Our first event happen on November 2018 and we had a total of XX apps/services that where showcase with pitch. For our upcoming events, we want also to add more activities towards other developers like _light talk_ and also session towards the public so we can use this opportunity to increase the awareness about technology and how they can take advantage of it.

## About the app.

The objectives of this app is are to offer the participants a tool to be more aware of what to be expected at the event through the schedule and during the event through different notifications.

We expect to increase meaningful engagements and to be able to gather instant feedback on the event so we can improve the upcoming events.
